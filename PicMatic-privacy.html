    <p class="p-legal__updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>PicMatic ("the App") is developed by Anton CGI ("we", "us", "our"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>PicMatic is designed with privacy at its core. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any personal identifiers.</li>
      <li>We do not access, upload, or transmit your photos or camera data to any server.</li>
      <li>We do not use analytics, tracking, or advertising frameworks.</li>
      <li>We do not collect device identifiers or usage statistics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Camera and Photo Library Access</h2>
    <p>PicMatic requires access to your device's camera to take photos and to your photo library to save captured images. This access is used exclusively on-device. No images or camera data ever leave your device through the App.</p>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>PicMatic offers a one-time lifetime purchase processed entirely through Apple's App Store. We do not receive, process, or store any payment information. All billing is handled by Apple in accordance with their privacy practices.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All App data (settings, preferences) is stored locally on your device. We do not operate any servers or cloud infrastructure that receives data from the App.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>PicMatic does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The only third-party interaction is with Apple's StoreKit framework for processing in-app purchases.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>PicMatic does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. Since the App does not collect personal data from any user, no special provisions for children's data are necessary.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:antoncgi@icloud.com">antoncgi@icloud.com</a>.</p>
